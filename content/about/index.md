  Hi! I'm Tara. I do a lot of thingsâ€”code, write, design, but most of all, I love building on the Web.
</p>

I currently work on [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com), an experimental browser that explores what happens when you integrate a p2p protocol into the Web.

Before working on Beaker, I spent time at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), an amazing community for programmers.
