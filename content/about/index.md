I'm a software engineer at [Indeed](https://indeed.com), where I work on a platform that teams use to build, test, and deploy their client-side applications. I live in Austin, TX.

I used to work at [Glitch](https://glitch.com) on the Developer Tools team, where we built a [collaborative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) in-browser [code editor](https://glitch.com/edit). Before Glitch, I worked on [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/about), an experimental browser that explores what happens when you integrate a peer-to-peer protocol into the Web. And before working on Beaker, I spent time at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), an amazing community for programmers.
