Today [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org) (CSS) announced
that its Executive Director, [Max Ogden](https://twitter.com/denormalize), will
step down from all leadership activities related to CSS and the
[Dat Project](https://datproject.org).

You can read the [Dat team's complete statement](https://blog.datproject.org/2017/12/20/organization-changes-dat-css), as well as the [CSS board's statement](https://codeforscience.org/static/CSSBoard-MO.pdf).

## Beaker's involvement

I work on the [Beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com), and part of our core
technology is `dat://`, a peer-to-peer protocol that's developed by the Dat Project
and sponsored by CSS.

While we have no official affiliation with CSS or the Dat Project, we work
closely with them as colleagues and friends, so when we saw a [report of
sexual abuse](https://twitter.com/jllord/status/941033391750819845) by Max
Ogden, we moved immediately to address it.

Since the report was made public, we've been working closely with [Danielle
Robinson, PhD](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins) and
[Joe Hand](https://twitter.com/joeahand) to establish how the Dat Project and
broader Dat community will move forward, and to support them as they've stepped
into new leadership roles.

## Moving forward

I'm proud to be part of a community that values holding its leaders and
members accountable for unacceptable behavior, and even prouder to work
with people who have risen to the immense challenge of holding their
boss, colleague, and friend accountable.

We will continue working with CSS and the Dat Project, with Danielle Robinson,
PhD and Joe Hand serving as co-Executive Directors, and
[Mathias Buus](https://github.com/mafintosh) (lead developer for Dat) stepping
up to serve as a Technical Advisor to CSS.
