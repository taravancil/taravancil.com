Here’s the news: I’m joining [Glitch](https://glitch.com)!

I’m joining as a front-end developer on the community team, where I’ll help maintain [glitch.com](https://glitch.com).

In November, [I announced](/blog/im-leaving-beaker) that I was leaving [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) <sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>. In short, I left because I want to be a full-time developer, but Beaker needed me as something more like a developer advocate/designer combo. I still love Beaker very much! It just isn’t the right team for me right now.

## Why Glitch?

I joined Beaker because I believed—and still do—that the Web is at its best when it makes space for _everyone_ to participate meaningfully.

> We believe the Web can (and must) be a people-first platform, where everybody is invited to create, personalize, and share.

If you’re familiar with my work on Beaker, the parallels between it and Glitch should be apparent: both are one-click tools for publishing websites and apps, both let you “fork” or “remix” projects, and both teams are motivated by the belief that **you shouldn’t have to be a professional developer to make, tweak, and explore the Web.**

### The Web as a canvas

Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have connected the world, sure, but they’ve also reduced online participation to a set of formats decided by character limits and emoji reactions.

Those constraints make sense on a global-scale social network, but if you look back on the creativity that came out of communities like [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities), you realize there's space on the Web for _much_ more than what social media affords.

There's space for a community that's built on building—one that sees the Web as a boundless canvas, and cherishes the beautiful (and the weird) that emerges when you invite the whole world to paint on it. There's space for Glitch.

## People are everything

Beyond building amazing tools, Glitch is committed to cultivating a friendly and fun community, no nonsense allowed. Further, Glitch and its previous incarnation, [Fog Creek](https://glitch.com/about/fog-creek-is-now-glitch/), have a long track record of treating workers well where it counts: good pay, great benefits, and [offices with doors](https://medium.com/make-better-software/beyond-open-offices-the-new-fog-creek-headquarters-bc2f70d7c7dc).

Joining Glitch is a natural next-step for me, and I'm so thankful for the chance to work with this stellar group of people.
