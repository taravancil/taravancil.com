I’m leaving [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com)! You might be expecting this post to expose a controversy or detail complaints about working on the project, but there is no controversy, and the complaints I do have will be familiar to anyone who’s formed a company or maintained an open-source project.

<!--more-->

I’m leaving Beaker because I want to be a full-time developer. I was a developer on Beaker—I built Beaker’s internal interfaces, [beakerbrowser.com](https://beakerbrowser.com), and a dozen or so websites and apps that demonstrated [Beaker’s peer-to-peer APIs](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat)—but *I was a part-time developer*.

I was a founder, designer, copywriter, and evangelist too. A significant chunk of my time was spent designing things like the Beaker website or Beaker’s editor, writing documentation and READMEs, preparing [presentations about Beaker](/speaking), and doing whatever else the project needed to move forward. My work was starting to look a lot more like the work of a developer advocate (and I’m proud of that work!), but it’s just not the kind of work I want to keep doing.

I want to be a full-time developer, but Beaker needs me as a full-time developer advocate, so it’s time for something new.

## What’s next?

Beaker is doing great and will carry on just fine without me. We recently raised a modest investment round that will allow us to keep working on Beaker and to test its long-term sustainability, and to even hire a person or two (whoa). I hold a significant stake in [the company that houses Beaker](https://bluelinklabs.com) and I’ll remain a voting member of the board, so I’ll still be able to keep [Paul](https://pfrazee.hashbase.io) and [Mathias](https://github.com/mafintosh) in check :-)

As for me, I’m not sure yet what I’ll do next. It’ll most certainly involve being a developer on a team that builds stuff on the Web, but I’m still deciding where I think I’ll fit best. Feel free to [email](mailto:contact@taravancil.com) or [DM](https://twitter.com/taravancil) me if you’ve got any ideas!
