My kitchen is by no means a shipwreck, but there‚Äôs definitely room for improvement. I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of buzz about [Airtable](https://airtable.com) which proclaims to help you ‚Äúorganize anything‚Äù, so I thought ‚Äúhey some organization can‚Äôt hurt‚Äù and spent Sunday inventorying my entire kitchen.

## What‚Äôs wrong with my kitchen?

### What‚Äôs a shopping list?

A trip to the grocery store involves me strolling through each aisle, hoping the items we need will jump out at me. For me, this scan-every-aisle approach works better than trying to write a shopping list by peering into the fridge and piecing together what‚Äôs missing, but it‚Äôs not perfect.

Walking every aisle takes time, and sometimes I still forget things! Fewer things than if I wrote a shopping list from memory, but it‚Äôd be nice to not forget things.

### Cooking isn‚Äôt hard, but planning is

Over the years I‚Äôve realized that preparing a meal is the least burdensome part of the cooking process. Surveying what ingredients I have available and deciding what to make for dinner demands much more of my attention.

I cook at least one meal a day, so going through that decision-making process every day eats up a non-negligible chunk of my time and energy.

### Food waste

When I buy items with a short shelf life, like fresh basil, mint, or ripe avocados, I often forget about them before it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôd like to stop wasting so much food, and to be able to make the dishes that I set out to make in the first place.

## Fixing my kitchen

I went into this project hoping that Airtable could help me do three things:

1. Build an automatically-generated shopping list
2. Tell me which recipes I can make based on my inventory
3. Highlight perishable items that will expire soon, so I can make an effort to use them

I was able to accomplish all three and I‚Äôm so stoked! I feel like my kitchen is a well-oiled machine now.

## How I did it

### Step 1: Inventory

I started off by creating an Airtable ‚Äúbase‚Äù called ‚ÄúKitchen‚Äù. A base is basically a workspace for a project.

Then I inventoried my entire kitchen. My fridge, cupboards, freezer, spice drawer, everything. This took several hours, but I found it an enjoyable and relaxing Sunday chore.

Each record in the `Inventory` table has the following fields:

```
- Name (single line text)
- Quantity (integer)
- Intake date (date)
- Lifetime (integer, how many days I expect it to last beyond its intake date)
- Staple? (checkbox, is this something we should always have on-hand?)
```

### Step 2: Recipes

Next I started importing my recipes. This took‚Ä¶a long time. That‚Äôs ok because it‚Äôs the kind of process that will never be finished, and I‚Äôm thrilled to have all the recipes I like in one place. I imported the few recipes I‚Äôd already published on my website, and also some of my favorites from other authors.

Each record in the `Recipes` table has the following fields:

```
- Name (single line text)
- Directions (Long text, includes ingredient quantities and directions)
- Ingredients (Link to Inventory records)
- Ingredients (optional) (Link to Inventory records)
- Image (an image)
- Author (Link to Authors records)
- Type (Multiple select)
- Oven temperature (single line text)
- Low carb? (checkbox)
```

Note: The `Authors` table just has one field, Name. Not interesting enough to say more about it.

Getting even this far was satisfying, because I had a beautiful grid of all my recipes in one place!

This was great! But I still hadn‚Äôt completed any of the features I set out to do. Onward.

### Step 3: Views, Formulas and Rollups

Once I finished entering records into the `Inventory` and `Recipes` tables, it was time to create some views.

#### Automatically generating a shopping list

I tackled the shopping list first because I suspected I‚Äôd able to get all the info I need just using Airtable‚Äôs filters, colors, and sort features, and I was right!

I created a new Grid view over the `Inventory` table with two color rules applied. I highlighted staple items we‚Äôre completely out of (red) and items that we don‚Äôt have, but aren‚Äôt staples (yellow).

Then I added a filter that only shows items `Where Quantity <= 1`. And finally I added two sorts:

* `Staple?` from checked to unchecked
* `Quantity` in ascending order

The end result is an easy-to-read and automatically-generated shopping list! Airtable has a nice iOS app, so I‚Äôll be to update my inventory with my phone as I shop.

#### Highlighting items that will expire soon

Next up was a view for marking items that have expired or will expire soon. I already had fields for `Intake date` and `Lifetime` on `Inventory` records, so I knew if I could figure out [Airtable‚Äôs date and time functions](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-field-reference#date_and_time_functions) I‚Äôd be on my way.

I added four new `Formula` fields to `Recipes` records which calculate if an item is perishable, if it‚Äôs expired, or if it‚Äôs about to expire soon.

```
- Perishable?
  - AND({Lifetime}, {Intake date}, Quantity > 0)
- Days remaining
  - IF({Perishable?}, Lifetime - DATETIME_DIFF(NOW(), {Intake date}, 'days'), '')
- Expired?
  - AND({Perishable?}, Lifetime - DATETIME_DIFF(NOW(), {Intake date}, 'days') <= 0)
- Expiring soon?
  - AND({Perishable?}, NOT({Expired?}), Lifetime - DATETIME_DIFF(NOW(), {Intake date}, 'days') < 3)
```

Finally I filtered out non-perishable items, added color labels to records that have expired (red) or will expire soon (yellow), and then sorted the results:

`Expired?` in descending order
`Expiring soon?` in descending order
`Days remaining` in ascending order

The result is a succinct list that I can quickly glance at as a reminder of which ingredients I should make an effort to use immediately.

#### Creating a list of recipes I can make with the current inventory

Last up is making a list of recipes I can make at any given moment. I was worried this would be difficult, but it turned out to be the simplest task of all!

I needed to use a type of field called a `Rollup`, which is for aggregating data from a field that links to a different table. Not totally intuitive at first, but once you see it in action it might make more sense.

So each `Recipes` record has an `Ingredients` field that links to `Inventory` records. If all the linked records in the `Ingredients` field have a `Quantity > 0`, then I can make the recipe!

I added a new `Rollup` field to the `Recipes` table and told Airtable that I want to look at the `Ingredients` field and summarize each one‚Äôs `Quantity`. Then I just needed to provide an aggregation function to give me a meaningful value. I used `AND(values)` because if even one `Quantity is 0`, I can‚Äôt make the recipe!

Finally I made a new Grid view over the `Recipes` table called ‚ÄúOn the menu‚Äù with just one simple filter: `Where Can make? = 1`.

And that‚Äôs it! Now I have a list of recipes I can make at any given moment based on what‚Äôs in my fridge and cupboards. I have a feeling this will go a long way to reduce how much time I spend planning meals, and I man, I‚Äôm stoked about it.

## What‚Äôs next?

Probably nothing! It would be nice to be able to press a button that can automatically update my inventory after making a recipe, but I‚Äôll save that for another weekend. For now, I‚Äôm over the moon excited about how this turned out.

Have you tried something like this before? Is there a killer Airtable feature I‚Äôm missing out on that would be useful here? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/taravancil)!
