I love this design (inspired by [topknotnails](https://instagram.com/topknotnails))!
I did it on top of my second set of acrylics, which fortunately didn't take six
hours like the first time, and also turned out much less lumpier. I'm getting the
hang of it! I really enjoy wearing acrylics, they make my nails feel so much
stronger, and give me the confidence to use my hands without worrying about
breaking or bending a nail. I have a feeling I'll be wearing acrylics pretty
much all the time from now on. I don't see why not to.
