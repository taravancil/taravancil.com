title: The Beaker Browser
date: 2019-09-01
description: |
  An experimental browser for exploring and building the peer-to-peer Web. Built with Electron.

  In addition to standard browser interfaces like tabs, history, and bookmarks, we built several unique capabilities to support downloading and publishing peer-to-peer content from the browser. Most notably, we developed an in-browser text editor for creating and publishing websites,  "forking" other peer-to-peer websites, and viewing peer network activity for a given website.
