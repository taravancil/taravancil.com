Brown the beef. While it browns, saute the onions in butter or oil. Add the
minced garlic and saute for about 30 seconds.

Once the beef is browned, season with salt, then add tomato paste and marmite.
Add beans, diced tomato, corn, paprika, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic
powder. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cover and simmer for a little while to let the liquid soak into the beans. Or
not.

Turn off burner and stir in cheese.
